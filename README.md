# 100 exercices to improve with GOLANG

> Practice makes makes the master - Patrick

## Intro

I hadn't find any good repository with 100 exercices for the GO Programming language, and as It's a language that has caught my attention, I will create it myself :smile: feel free to contribute and use it! 

I assume you have go installed and have taken a quick grap about how GO works :) 
## Overview

My main idea is that the exercices are structured like this:

- From 1 to 15  : Basic exercices
- From 16 to 19 : File management
- From 20 to 31 : Intermediate exercices
- From 32 to 44 : Concurrency
- From 45 to 48 : Time
- From 49 to 53 : JSON
- From 54 to 67 : HTTP & APIs
- From 68 to 74 : Testing & misc
- From 75 to 85 : Database (non-relational(mongo)) + CRUD API with Fiber



And inside of each exercice, it's explanation :) and solution inside the `solution` folder
```sh
├── n-th_exercise            #<- exercise number
│    ├── main.go
│    ├── [.env]
│    └── solution            #<- solution folder
│       └── solution.go      
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```
