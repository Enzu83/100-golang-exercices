# 100 exercices to improve with GOLANG

> Practice makes makes the master - Patrick

## Intro

I hadn't find any good repository with 100 exercices for the GO Programming language, and as It's a language that has caught my attention, I will create it myself :smile: feel free to contribute and use it! 

I assume you have go installed and have taken a quick grap about how GO works :) 
## Overview

My main idea is that the exercices are structured like this:

- From 1 to 15   : Basic exercices
- From 16 to 19  : File management
- From 20 to 31  : Intermediate exercices
- From 32 to 44  : Concurrency
- From 45 to 48  : Time
- From 49 to 53  : JSON
- From 54 to 61  : Context
- From 62 to 68  : Interfaces
- From 69 to 82  : HTTP & APIs
- From 83 to 
- From 68 to 74  : Testing & misc
- From 75 to 85  : Database (non-relational(mongo)) + CRUD API with Fiber
- From 86 to 93  : Context
- From 94 to 100 : Interfaces


And inside of each exercice, it's explanation :) and solution inside the `solution` folder
```sh
├── n-th_exercise            #<- exercise number
│    ├── main.go
│    ├── [.env]
│    └── solution            #<- solution folder
│       └── solution.go      
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

Please notice there are some exercises that are intended to have an execution failure, the important thing here is learning!
Feel free to contribute, comment, have fun or just provide feedback!

Thanks a lot
