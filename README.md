# 100 exercices to improve with GOLANG

> Practice makes makes the master - Patrick

## Intro

I hadn't find any good repository with 100 exercices for the GO Programming language, and as It's a language that has caught my attention, I will create it myself :smile: feel free to contribute and use it! 

I assume you have go installed and have taken a quick grap about how GO works :) 
## Overview

My main idea is that the exercices are structured like this:

- From 1 to 15: Basic super n00b exercices
- From 16 to 19: File management
- From 20 to 31: Intermediate exercices
- From 32 to : Concurrency


And inside of each exercice, it's explanation :) [and solution?]
