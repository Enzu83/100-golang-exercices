// Exercise: Final exercise: Concurrency

// Create 2 goroutines, one called number() and the other called letter(), without any arguments, and without any returns
// The number() function will print a number from 0 to 9, waiting for 200 milliseconds between each iteration
// The letter() function will print the 10th first alphabet words, waiting for 200 millisecs between each iteration
// In the main program, call the go routines and print a meessage, see how it behaves.
